      ["Given my love for basketball, it only makes sense that I work on a project related to it! LeStat is a responsive React web app that lets users search any active NBA player and instantly view their 2024-2025 season statistics, team jersey, and player details. Built with a modern, component-based architecture, the app integrates the NBA API via RapidAPI to fetch and process real-time data, including per-game averages and player bio information.", 
      "Designed with a strong emphasis on user experience, the app features smooth transitions, responsive layouts, and interactive elements such as dynamic jerseys (that change given player input), team logos, and country flags. Errors are handled aswell."],

      ["BrainBank is a Chrome side-panel extension that transforms the way you engage with text online. Highlight any passage, pick from an AI preset like ELI5 (explain-like-im-5), Skeptic, Researcher, Tutor, or Interviewer, and instantly receive a useful response.  Entries are saved into a personal journal (to look back at) and the generated output is synced across Chrome via \`chrome.storage.sync\`. Users can edit their UI through the Theme Studio and change their username and profile avatar.",
